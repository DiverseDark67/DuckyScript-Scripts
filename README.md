# DuckyScript-Scripts
This is a repository of different Ducky-Scripts I have Developed. These are not intended to be used maliciously. I am not responsible for any mal-use or damage caused by these scripts. Always get consent to use any of these scripts on someone else's device.
To use any of these scripts on a Rubber Ducky bad USB you must convert the text file from .txt to an inject.bin file. Other Hacking tools such as the Flipper Zero might require the Flipper Unleased firmware to run Ducky Script.
